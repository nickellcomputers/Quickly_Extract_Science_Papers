Jeff, a 44-year-old male from Manchester, CT, originally hails from Lansdale, PA. He graduated from North Penn High School in 1997 and went on to earn a BS in Psychology from Kutztown University (1997-2001) and an Associates in Information Sciences & Tech from Penn State Lehigh Valley and Penn State Reading (2001-2003). 

As a child, Jeff enjoyed computers, baseball, skiing, alternative and classic rock music, and outdoor activities like mountain biking and fishing. His first job was at Genuardi supermarket at 16, where he also had a work-study during high school. He later worked at Sikorsky Aircraft (2002-2005), RCM Technologies (2005-2007), and United Natural Foods (UNFI) as a programmer until he was laid off in 2009. In 2018, he began working with a major client, Career Team, as a programmer and project manager.

Jeff discovered his passion for philosophy and psychology in his senior year of high school. He experimented with substances in his youth and embraced a modern-day hippie lifestyle. In 2010, he co-founded The Conduit Center, a meditation center, with his friend Owen and remained involved until 2020. Jeff now runs a sound meditation group called Svara Sound with Kim and a small web design business, Nickell Computers.

Jeff has been in several relationships, including a long-term one with Gina, who introduced him to sound healing. He currently lives with his girlfriend Megan, who has three sons, Shepherd (7), Sawyer (9), and Finn (13). Despite struggling with shyness and social anxiety, Jeff has made significant progress over the years. He is a hard worker, a great programmer, and loves sound healing as a passion. However, he sometimes finds it challenging to motivate himself without external requests.

Jeff's life has been marked by personal growth, exploration of interests, and overcoming challenges. He has navigated through heartbreak, job loss, and social anxiety, finding solace and strength in sound healing and meditation. His journey reflects his resilience, adaptability, and continuous pursuit of personal and professional development.
