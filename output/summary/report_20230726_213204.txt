Jeff, a 44-year-old male from Manchester, CT, was born and raised in Lansdale, PA. He attended Gwynn Nor Elementary, Penn View Christian for 4th-6th, North Penn Junior High, and graduated from North Penn High School in 1997. He then pursued a BS in Psychology from Kutztown University (1997-2001) and an Associates in Information Sciences & Tech from Penn State Lehigh Valley and Penn State Reading (2001-2003).

Growing up, Jeff was passionate about computers, baseball, skiing, alternative and classic rock music, and outdoor activities like mountain biking and fishing. His first job was at Genuardi supermarket at 16, and he had a work-study there in high school. He later worked at Sikorsky Aircraft (2002-2005), RCM Technologies (2005-2007), and United Natural Foods (UNFI) as a programmer until he was laid off in 2009. In 2018, he began working with a major client, Career Team, as a programmer and project manager.

Jeff discovered his interest in philosophy and psychology in his senior year of high school. He experimented with substances in his youth and embraced a modern-day hippie lifestyle. In 2010, he co-founded The Conduit Center, a meditation center, with his friend Owen and remained involved until 2020. Jeff now runs a sound meditation group called Svara Sound with Kim. He also runs a small web design business, Nickell Computers.

Jeff has been in several relationships, including a long-term one with Gina, who introduced him to sound healing. He currently lives with his girlfriend Megan, who has three sons, Shepherd (7), Sawyer (9), and Finn (13). Jeff has struggled with shyness and social anxiety but has made progress over the years. He is a hard worker, a great programmer, and loves sound healing as a passion. However, he sometimes finds it challenging to motivate himself without external requests.

Jeff's mother passed away in 2022, and he often visits his childhood home, now his father's house, in Pennsylvania. He also has four pets and enjoys their company despite the stress they sometimes bring. Jeff is also interested in AI tech, dance communities, and yoga, and he enjoys camping and outdoor activities. He has a strong desire to reconnect with old friends and often reflects on his past to understand his interests and goals better.
