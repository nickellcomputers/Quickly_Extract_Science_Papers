He graduated with a BS in Psychology from Kutztown University and an Associates in Information Sciences & Tech from Penn State. His early education was at Gwynn Nor Elementary, Penn View Christian, North Penn Junior High, and North Penn High School.

Growing up, Jeff had a keen interest in computers, baseball, skiing, alternative and classic rock music, and outdoor activities like mountain biking and fishing.

He now runs a sound meditation group called Svara Sound with Kim and a small web design business, Nickell Computers.
