Team Member 2: I can take that up. I will need the product details and the key selling points.

Manager: Great. Please coordinate with the product team for the details. Also, we need to create a landing page for the product on our website. Who can handle that?

Team Member 3: I can work on the landing page. I will need the product images and descriptions.

Manager: Perfect. Please coordinate with the design and product teams for the required details. Lastly, we need to plan an email campaign for our existing customers. Any volunteers?

Team Member 4: I can handle the email campaign. I will need the customer database and the product details.

Manager: Excellent. Please coordinate with the sales and product teams for the details. Let's aim to have everything ready by the end of next week.

    Q: Can you give me a very clear concise summary of the meeting?
   </p>

    A: Meeting Summary:

The meeting focused on the upcoming product launch, with the main discussion revolving around finalizing marketing strategies. The team decided to promote the product through social media, a dedicated landing page on the company website, and an email campaign. Team Member 2 was assigned to handle social media promotions, Team Member 3 was tasked with creating the landing page, and Team Member 4 took responsibility for the email campaign. All tasks are to be completed by the end of next week.
   </p>
   <p>
    Q: Can you give me an analogy or metaphor that will help explain this to a broad audience.
   </p>
   <p>
    A: Sure, think of this product launch as a grand theater production. The product is the star of the show, but it needs a strong supporting cast to ensure its success. 

The social media promotions handled by Team Member 2 are like the billboards and posters around town, creating a buzz and anticipation for the show. 

The landing page created by Team Member 3 is the theater itself, where the audience gets to see the star (the product) in all its glory. 

The email campaign managed by Team Member 4 is like the invitations sent out to loyal theater-goers, inviting them to come and enjoy the new production. 

And the deadline is the opening night, when everything needs to be ready for the curtain to rise and the star (the product) to shine.

    Hey, Jeff. Hey, Jeff. Hello. Hey, everybody. Hello. Hello. How are you today? I'm good. How are you doing, Jeff? Doing okay. How are you guys? Good. You ready to get started? Good. Jumping in. Yeah. Let's jump in. Vivian was just building a resume within Career Edge, so she asked that we start there, Jeff, just to give you a little background. Start with the resumes? Yeah. I'm going to share my screen. Yeah. She was just starting. Okay. I wanted to go through and do a resume on my own, so I would know what we're talking about, too, because I hadn't been in here for a while. One of the things I noticed is ... Can everybody see my screen with the resume sections? Yes. Yep. I can. I noticed, Jeff, that there's no objective section. It was supposed to ... Oh, I guess it's the ... Part of it. I think it's part of it about you. Let me show you what happened. I think here ... Oh, skills. We're in the skills section, but it has the objective part on the top, and then it has the skills part on the bottom, so it's combined in the same section. Okay. Yeah. We should have an objectives section, just for objectives, and then skills section, right? Yeah. Is that what you said? Yes. About you, and then objectives, and then skills, and everything else to follow. Correct. Okay. Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. I don't know. Somehow they combined those. All right. Yep. I see. Now, you can see I'm building an auto-tech resume, but ... With the skills part, what I was thinking, if it's possible, so up here, it's all of the things ... These are all of the ones that we suggested that you preloaded. That's perfect. Mm-hmm. But when I came on here, my first thought, I was looking at it as a student that's never been on here. It's like, well, what do I ... It's suggestions. What do I do with those? Is it possible, instead of having the suggestions up here and this section down here, is it possible just to have these loaded in here already, and just make a little note up here? You can remove or add any bullets you'd like, meaning ... You would not have this section up here. You would just automatically have cooling and maintenance, electrical, pre-populate here, so they'll see right away that that's going to go on their resume. Then you can have just up here writing, like, if a skill doesn't apply, click it to remove, or something like that. Then you can keep this on the bottom, where it says, add another bullet. Yeah. I thought from the start that that's the way it does operate with a new resume, when aren't they already ... They should already be selected, because we just limited them to 10. Is it ... I just want to make sure it's still initially behaving correctly. Yes, it does pre-populate into ... Here, so let me show you. This is one of the resumes that I had done, so since, as you saw, I didn't pick all of those. I didn't pick all of these, but they did pre-populate. I think it's confusing, because ... Well, this one's confusing to me, because they're populating under education, and that's ... Well, that was the next thing. Well, that was the next thing. Is this just one of the templates, or is this ... I guess we need to test it a little more, because when I was testing, it didn't ... I did all of them, look. Okay. Yeah. It's just populating skills under it, so that's not right, and then ... But there is a skills section that's populating now. Okay. But the skills section only took what I put in it, so whatever I ... If you can see, I added the three, the four skills. I added four under here. Those are the ones that showed under the skills section, but under education, everything's still populated. Okay. All right. Well, we'll definitely get rid of the bullets under education, and then ... So, for this skills section, if these ought to populate in the beginning when you create a resume, which they should, but I guess they're initially not populating all those underneath. Those are just ... Right, so under this skills section, when I did the template, only what ... It gives you the suggestion, but only what I specifically put in the bullet point boxes is what came into the template, Jeff. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah. I understand you understood my other thought of, we shouldn't have the option to click it up here. I'd like them to see, instead of suggestions, this is going to be what's automatically going to be on their resume. Yeah. Okay. And then they could use, to get rid of those, they could use the clear bullets button.
right exactly clear everything or but to remove and then to remove each one would they just delete them manually or so I'm thinking you know how do they delete individual bullets are they just well maybe just like oh yeah okay let's start here right and then they could say feel you know you can remove any bullet that doesn't apply and add any other bullets that Sherry if you select the clear bullet points below if you just click this is a clear everything out it did it does okay so I don't know that you really want that right you I don't think they would want to clear everything well I think they would want to school like so I think so I know from our directors meeting some some of the directors voice that they couldn't get rid of the skill once it was already pre-selected so I feel like we should have the option to dislike to not to erase a skill right so that's what I think so that would be at the bullet point so my vision is everything up here with the pluses should automatically show up in one of these sections right yes and it's not have that not have this at all and then some instructions where you can click individual ones to remove them and you can add additional skills yeah and so this do you think so that clear all bullet points is not really as useful unless it was it might have been just for that one use case where there was a lot of bullets from before is that why we were yeah I don't remember why we did that but I think that's what it was it was it was just a short period where there was when we had changed over to the ten bullets ten to twelve bullets and some of the students had still like twenty bullets on there you know so we wanted to get like a quick way to kind of but I think that's that's not happening anymore so maybe we don't need that clear all bullets right I'm thinking because if we're going to automatically populate it the bullets are going to be appropriate for them they may just like let's say I don't like to do real online until I failed that class and I may just take that off because I don't want people to ask me about that okay I wonder if like if there was a maybe a minus button each next each text box or something where they could just delete her that would be great so if they like if I if that one wasn't appropriate I could hit minus and that one would come off yeah yeah I could I could ask the team on that and see see what they say come back with but yeah that might be a good option too yeah I think that would be a better option and then again I love this because they can add another you just click this and add as many more that they choose to do yeah make sense yeah okay wait so let me see what oh and then on education on the top here we just need to because we change this we need to take out and select the skills you obtain from your training on the wording okay so just leave it at let's say make sure that we're excited programs of study and your GPA I'll show me word that you just we could remove and select but how do you actually so in this section enter the schools who have attended programs of study and enter your GPA if yeah okay okay that sounds good now I was also let me just think so then the other thing with let me just I'm just checking the work experience education so let me ask you this so so we have the option to select if you're sending your resume out before you check before you graduate check this box and anticipated graduation date so if there's nothing here so I guess if I check the anticipated graduate if I check this box and the anticipated graduation will show up but if I don't check it it won't show up right right right and if I check this do I have to put this in and it won't let me go any further if you check that it will just put that default date that's already populated but my point wise is it I went through it once already so I don't remember so if I don't if I don't pick a date well it is a date required if I check this box I guess is my question yeah the dates the date is required currently I'm sure it's well let's see well isn't that linked I thought it was linked with campus view I thought it was
See, I put this date in, this didn't come up. My other question is, if I fill out an anticipated graduation date, but I don't check this, what date will show up on my resume, do you know? I think it won't have the words anticipated graduation date at all on the resume, it should just be using the start to end date you have above. Okay, so then it won't show this date, even if I put this date in by mistake, it will still show, and not select that, it will still show? Yeah, if you have that unselected, then that 7-27 won't show, it will just be using the start to end dates above. And then I know we talked about grabbing that out of campus view anyway. Yeah, I thought we did that, but I should check into that. Okay. To make sure, double check that. I think the rest was okay. Let's see, I think this came out okay. I did see that in one of them, let me find, the boxes still showed up on the resume itself. Actually, it's interesting, see the one we're looking at now? Yeah. When I did it earlier, the one I took a screenshot of, this is so funny, it's right on there, but look, this was the one I did earlier. This has the box, yeah. Now, when you get it in Word, did the box, like if you... I think the preview sometimes, I've seen it behave differently than the way that Word outputs, so it's important to check that Word is outputting correctly. Let's see, so that has... So the boxes you're saying, meaning the table elements? Yes, yes, the table. So we're trying to get rid of the table? Yes. Let's see. And you know what I just thought of too, does it show up, when you print this, does it show up orange? Because we were going to get rid of that too. No, that was taken out. That's why these previews aren't as accurate. I think it's using Google to preview versus Microsoft Word, so that's why it's a little different. Are we able to change that? The preview? Yeah. Yeah, because it should mirror what they did. Let's take a quick note. Alright. Okay. Now, I'm going to send you, I just saved all these in a weird document, I'll send them to you Jeff, because simple things like this, like certification, but it has CPR and then two semicolons, which shouldn't be. You know, there were a couple other things, like here, there's another semicolon right here before community college, that's the second education. Yep. When we were looking at, this is the second template, the one with the tables on it. Do you know what they did, I guess they had a table for two, if they get rid of the tables they should be able to, because we know what these bullet points are going to be, because we put them in, they can run the words on one line, like cooling system maintenance can all be on one line here. Line up better, because we have enough room. Yeah, and I'd like to see the word document too. It's probably just making the column bigger. And if you have a different way of outputting, like a word doc, instead of it being those tables, like to not have tables, and you've done that successfully, if you can send that to us, because they really model after the word document that's done, so if you had like a template that you've created, where the bullets aren't in those boxes, this is a different way of doing it, and I think you mentioned there was a different way of doing it, but if you can output that and send that to me, they should be able to model after that exactly. Okay, now will they have any play, like let's say I do three columns, and one column wraps around or whatnot, is there some coding they can do to make that not happen?
happen or make sure the columns are even? I think it's a little tricky because it's it's just going off of whatever word the way that word behaves so if you're throwing a line that does wrap in there I think it I think it just it naturally does sometimes wrap like that but I don't think this preview is accurate I think that the word document would come out with these bullets on one line okay so I don't think this one we're looking at this I don't think it's as accurate as the word doc okay then you may have to I'll send you the word doc but you may still have to look on how it actually prints out and I just know it's like the date here also should be underneath here underneath the restaurant yes oh you mean like wait on the second just it should be a restaurant and then it should be the day because it's oh I see it yep I see it yep I think the other one above is that way yep I see Gallantown and when we look at under education the city and state should not be bolded just yeah well you know it's interesting it's bolded in education and it's but it's not bolded in the work experience right I'm just really curious if the word doc is coming out the same way or if we're just looking at the preview and the previews kind of funny yeah and we'll try to get you know let's let's mirror the word doc as the preview like you said and I don't know if there's any way to program it so that if there's only this much if they can put more like spaces after you know they can space it a little better to make it bigger like the yeah longer like you know you could leave another you know a space or two before at each heading mm-hmm you know to drop it down so it looks nicer on the page yeah it's spaced out yeah that makes sense and this one looks nice the one thing I did see is though after volunteering and certifications they have a next a bullet point showed up after each one was that template for you know and the volunteering and certifications to see these bullet points right here yeah yeah I don't think these are all the same this looks like different fonts we used a great cross no doubt it doesn't look like waiter and wait tables it's different fonts okay now interestingly enough this one it might be a template but this one didn't doesn't even have a skills it has an objective right now the skills didn't come out at all on that one the skills section skills missing on that yeah is that the last one yes I'm gonna go look back at the other ones because I didn't notice that on any other and then and then the other ones actually say profile instead of objective again you might yeah I do think yeah I'm still thinking it's these previews but I but I'll double check that too we got to get the previews working right yeah so objective skills education all right and then in this volunteering I guess there was was there something filled out for volunteering or just throws a bullet now I just I just wrote Red Cross Philadelphia and I didn't go ahead other anything in and it should the date showed up the same thing for the certification I just put in CPR Philadelphia I didn't even put a date on that one okay that's good that's very good yeah we will we'll get those right in the to get that fixed that's the builder so the awards section should be being outputted out there
on all the resume templates now. And yeah, we'll get the skills away from the, out of the education section. Just get all that up in order. Okay. Yeah. So for, yeah, so should we, can we move to the workshops and just kind of some of the other stuff that we, one thing that we did do was we had removed the locking mechanism on the workshops. So what on the workshops? I didn't hear that. The locking. So you could go back in and view them again. Oh, okay. Yes. Okay. Good. Let me see if I can. Share my screen. So here, I'll make you a presenter. Hold on a second. Sorry. Yeah. Make you a presenter. All right. You should be good to go. All right. Let me see here. Share. Let's make sure I do this right. All right. We see your screen. Okay. Great. So this is the workshop page. What we did was basically removing the locking mechanism so you can go back in. One of the things was being able to save notes. I think it was reported that you couldn't save notes. Yeah. If you click the save button. Let's see if we can go back into. So the notes are saving. As long as you click that save button, your notes will be saved for each workshop. Now, Jeff, is there a way that they could download those notes if they wanted to? Or? That's the thing I was wondering. Because, yeah, I wasn't sure how we wanted to do that. Do we want to do that for the students? I wasn't sure. I wasn't clear on what we wanted to do. It was for the administrators or if it's for the students? So. It's for the students, I think. For the students. Yeah, if they wanted to save their notes from what they just took, yeah. Yeah, we could make like a download button here and maybe, I think, probably output it as like a PDF or something. Yeah. Does that sound good? Yeah. Okay. Or even, I don't know if it's possible, like even if there's a way to like combine, like if there was an output, like for all, let's say somebody wanted to print all their notes for all four, excuse me, like could there be a way that it combines the notes and like titles them, okay, this one was in communication, this one was in professional, these notes were in professional branding and just print one sheet for all the notes? Should we put, where would that, where should we put that? I guess is where, would it be like download all your notes button or underneath the workshop? Oh, that would be great on that, yeah. Yeah. It would be the notes after they finish. So whether it's next to each one or. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think if you would probably, let's see, so either download all notes or download, I mean, there could be a download button under each one, download notes, download notes. Because I see they might want, they may take one class today and want to download those notes and not take another one for another two weeks. So. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe individually. Um, I mean, we probably could do both. It's up to you, I guess. If we want to, we'll put a download button under each, download your notes, download notes under each of these. And then do we want like a, do we want a download all notes button or try for that? I don't, you know, we could, I think we could do it. Yeah. I don't know if that's necessary, but if anybody thinks it is, I think, you know, they would, in general, they would do it after each one. Yeah. If anybody thinks it's important, then, you know, then I'm okay with that too. I think for right now under each one is fine. I agree. And then like, if we, if we see that like students would rather it be all together, you know, we can do an update or something. Yeah, I think that's the way to go for now. Okay. So they, if they do get their badges, they can click on to now view the badge. Nice. Each one. Right. And back into, let's see. Workshops, anything else for workshops? All right, we'll, we'll put in for that. I think otherwise, everything else is fixed. Now, what if, wasn't there a thing? A certificate? Yes. When somebody completes all four classes, there was like a mayor's certificate or something. It was like, there was pulling from something else. This is what it shows now for, if you completed all your workshops, you get a badge. Now we could.
This is what we have had designed. What about if you can see all four? Is there a certificate, Josh? This is what you get. This is the badge that Darian had created. We could do something else. So if you see all four, you get the orientation badge? Yes. I don't know if orientation is the right word. That's not what that's for. I mean, I don't think it's very clear. I think, yeah, I think we had it as a workshop. You know, we should, we should replace that. Or let's, how should we do it, I guess? I honestly, it's definitely not orientation and we know Sherry and Mackenzie and Ruth, but I would love to be able, once they complete all four, for they actually get a certificate to download. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. That's what I was, that's what I thought. Like they can print it, download it, and then print it. Yeah, that's what I thought. You have successfully completed all four CareerEdge workshops. You can even name the four on them, on the certificate. Okay. I think maybe like, I guess what we just need is a template of a certificate or some ones that we like or I can, I'll shoot it at the design team to see. We have certificates that we've used for other programs, Jeff, for our government ones that we, for you, unless Lincoln internally has a certificate that they have, that marketing has developed for them, we can add that. It's up to them. That would be great because we have some, but we tend to use the same ones over and over, so I'd love it if you had, you know, one that's very different that's clearly from, you know, says CareerEdge. Okay, I'm going to pull up a certificate, Jeff, for you right now, and I'm going to email it over to you. We're just going to have to change the colors and add the Lincoln logo on it. So, I still, I think it would appear here, and there would be a download button once they complete it. But we, you would have to put that somewhere else, like, because each one would be their own badge, and then you would have probably another button underneath, you know, all four, you know, all four completed, print your certificate or something like that. Yeah, I think it would appear right, like, a button would appear below the four to say, you know, you've awarded certificate or download certificate, something like that. Mm-hmm, yep. Okay. And will that certificate show on, like, the admin side, like, because they'll have all four that would be highlighted green, right, that they've taken, that they've taken at all, or four check marks. So, would it, could there's, like, I'm just thinking, like, sometimes we do different, like, award ceremonies at the campus. That could be something that the directors could give at a ceremony if there's, does it show up on the admin side? Should we put, like, another check mark to say all four completed, or, like, let's take a look at the admin side, I guess. And who would be the signer on that? Probably Susan and I. Okay, so then what we would need, we can add electronic signatures on the template, if that works for you. Yeah. What is exactly Susan's title? I knew you were going to ask that. I'm putting that up right now, so I don't misspeak. What's your title? I don't even know. I'm Vice President of Career Services. Okay. VP or Vice President, do you want written out? You could do, well, let's see what we're going to do for her. So, we could do VP, because we're, let's see here. Yeah, it looks like we have enough for all four. Let's see here. Yeah, it looks like we have enough room, because I'm not going to put them right next to each other, so we can leave it Vice President. Okay, and she's got a longer one. It's SVPCS, the ambersound, and industry partnerships. So, it's SVPCS and industry partnerships. So, she's Senior Vice President of Career Services, Industry Partnerships. And industry partnerships. Nothing to see, Susan. Let me see, that's online. So, Jeff, if like you go into that test student who took all four courses, like if where, like if somebody wanted to print out that certificate, would it be in like their account info, or? It could be. I guess it's a, yeah, it's a design question. We could, what would be easiest for you as the user? So, we would say, should we? Shouldn't we just in the admin side have something that says they completed it, and just have the certificate on the student size for them to print out?
print it just my thought yeah I don't know if we need to I get what you're saying McKenzie like we present it to them yeah I don't think it would happen all the time but it might happen right I could see somebody doing it yeah which would be a nice thing but I don't know if we can't get it out of here I think that's I think that would be okay the other thing is do you want to call them the career services workshops what do you want to call them what are they listed in let me go back to my screen what do we list them in what do we list them in career edge here we have them under the career services tab it's got frozen let me see if I get back here like career work they call them career workshops so why don't you just say career workshops like just like what they're called here you can do we want to put the names of each of the workshops underneath like in a smaller print if it doesn't make it too busy okay I'll play around with that all right so this and if you know what if you can't get the names on it then just say you create you you completed all four or successfully completed all four career workshops if you can't get the names on it I'm fine with that okay so I have congratulations this certifies that student name has successfully completed the career workshops and and is therefore awarded this certificate of completion and then we'll have the auto generate a date do you want to date on it or probably can we do that job auto generate a date the awards are we able to do that well we'd have to audit generate the whole certificate I guess because we're gonna have to put this name on it too well I guess we do that with PDF so well you know I can ask the team and then do you for the name because I always just call it Lincoln is it Lincoln Technical Institute that you want on it you do Lincoln Tech Lincoln Tech yeah the only way to brand you for years before yeah so for the euphoria students Jeff ideally we would want the name euphoria and the euphoria logo right on it mm-hmm yeah yeah I'm thinking if we can just if it can be all generated which we kind of do with our assignments where we we output a PDF file and with the background image and everything and then the text where it should go I might not you know I'm thinking it wouldn't be a problem and then of course if you're you know logged in as euphoria would put that image versus the regular Lincoln so we just need the correct logos and marketing yeah say Susan's title one more time for me I want to make sure I have this right I've seen your vice president the answer hang on one second so she I'm gonna I'm gonna share my screen because I looked up how she signed herself and hold on one second because now I'm going away I can type it would be good Jeff you might have to stop sharing so that Sherry can share yes all right it should be good all righty get the right okay and I'll make it bigger for you so this is this is how she can you see that yep got it all right that makes sense it's different in our house but that's how she puts it so that's probably the best one to use and since she and she has FB
VP, Senior Vice President. Since I'm writing yours out, should I write hers out properly? I bet students won't realize what it is. Or if that's too long, just put VP for me. Just put VP for me. Either way. Okay. If you're okay with that. It doesn't matter. Whatever looks better. Alright, I think that will look better. Not big on titles. No, I do like my middle initial in my name now that we're talking about it. It's D's for David. Oh, Sherry D. Leach, did you say? Yes. Sherry D. Leach. Okay, perfect. Got it. We will work on this. And then we will work on everything else that we discussed on this call. And then, do you think that we should set up another meeting to review everything in about two weeks again? Since we did that the last time. I think so. I'm hoping, so Jeff, my first order would be the resume builder. Yes. First. We could set up a meeting in two weeks, but I'm really hoping a lot of that would be done before. Yeah, I'm going to put that right in. So, let me just see. I know you're off Mackenzie, but if Monday is working for everybody, we could do the 24th at the same time. That works for Danielle and Jeff. Yeah, that should work. We're almost there already. Almost through July. Don't even say it. It's wild. Are you going to the conference in New Orleans, Sherry? In New Orleans? No, I didn't know about that one. Which one is it? I might now. I think it's EQ. When is the EQ one? I believe it is August. Let's see here. CSPEN. C-S-P-E-N. New Orleans. Can you send me? Do you have an invite or an email on that? Oh, wow. They're holding at the Ritz-Carlton. I hope they allow us to stay there too, CareerEdge. And if they do, I'm going to bunk in with you. Exactly right. Career Schools Private Education Network. That's what it is. Okay. Looks like Career Team sponsored it. I will copy and paste this link to you right now. Okay. Thank you. And what date did you say that was? That is in August. August 14th. Monday, August 14th. Okay. Give it a check. All right. Great. I've been to one of theirs. I've been to New Orleans, which is great. I've never been to New Orleans. My daughter, she just went and had a conference there. It was her first time. But she came back. Now, it's probably been about 20, 25 years since I've been there. And I loved it. The homeless and the people that were high and strung out on the streets was awful. There were a lot of people. And I hadn't heard that about New Orleans. I heard that a lot about San Diego and San Francisco and some other places. I found out when I was out in San Francisco. But I'll have to let you know because I've never been there before. I got it. Thank you. Any other questions or do you have everything from the Lincoln ladies? I love our new coin name. A lot of things are still in progress. Ability to upload bulk job orders. They're looking for a sample file. I assume we would probably be using the same kind of structure in the files that we receive from Campus View. That's if somebody was going to manually send us bulk job orders. Cheri, you remember that? I suppose as long as they fill the template out the way that it's coming over from Campus View, then it shouldn't be an issue. Or we'd have to know if any changes. I guess that's how it would work, right? Somebody would just go into an Excel sheet and add jobs. Is that how we envisioned it? I think that's what we talked about and I think we were waiting to see what fields you needed. Maybe I'll send you the template.
the data over it's it's probably you know it's basically the same way as an Excel sheet so I can send it to you and see see if that's easy to manipulate or you know add on jobs or send a manual like Excel sheet to us and we can just automatically process that so. So if you send the template I can get yeah if you send the template I can have a school you know add a couple yeah and we can test those jobs. That would be good yeah okay that sounds good. I think that is it for now we're also making template adjustments that I believe Mackenzie you sent us so that's still in progress. Well yeah everything's there's just a lot kind of in progress right now so. And did you say what the same time was okay? Yep it works for me. Yep for me too. Okay I'll send that as soon as we get off. Awesome thank you guys for your time today. Oh absolutely thank you. Thank you. And then Jeff if you have any questions in the meantime while you're going through that just feel free to call me. Okay yeah thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right everybody have a great day. We'll talk to you later. Have a good one. Take care everyone. Okay bye.
